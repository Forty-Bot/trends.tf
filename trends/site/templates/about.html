	<h1>About {{ trends() }}</h1>
	<p>
	{{ trends() }} was born out of my desire to know all the useless stats about my gameplay. I
	wrote the initial version in two weeks in November, 2020. I was very focused, since I was
	going to start a new job and I wouldn't have as much free time. The initial version just had
	the overview, logs, peers, weapons, and trends tabs on the player page. At first I used
	<a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, which was great for getting started quickly, but
	I've since moved on to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. The rest of the
	stack has stayed mostly the same: <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>,
	<a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uWSGI</a>, and
	<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a>. Development continues in my free
	time, when I feel like it.
	</p>

	<h2>Infrequently-asked questions</h2>
	<h3>How often does {{ trends() }} update?</h3>
	<p>
	{{ trends() }} imports new data from <a href="https://logs.tf/">logs.tf</a>,
	<a href="https://demos.tf/">demos.tf</a>, <a href="https://etf2l.org/">ETF2L.org</a>, and
	<a href="https://rgl.gg/">RGL</a> every five minutes. Steam names and avatars are updated
	constantly, but it can take several hours to refresh them for all players. The leaderboard
	is updated daily. Most pages are cached for up to 30 seconds, although this can be extended
	if there is no new data.
	</p>

	<h3>Why don't the stats on {{ trends() }} match logs.tf?</h3>
	<p>
	Many servers upload logs in the middle of the game. So if you check {{ trends() }} right
	after your game ends, the mid-game logs will still be there. {{ trends() }} also does some
	post-processing to clean up the data.
	</p>

	<h3>Why doesn't the linked log on the trends page match the data?</h3>
	<p>
	The graphs on the trends page show a rolling average of the past few logs (20 by default).
	You can lower the window size, but it may make the graph noisier.
	</p>

	<h3>How do I have over 100% accuracy?</h3>
	<p>
	Accuracy is shots fired divided by shots hit. If you use a weapon with afterburn or bleed,
	one shot can result in multiple ticks of damage.
	</p>

	<h3>How do I filter by map type?</h3>
	<p>
	The map filter matches any part of the map name. So filtering by "cp_" would match all
	control-point maps. You can also use this to filter by all versions of a map. As an example,
	searching for "product" will match "koth_product_rcx" and "koth_product_final".
	</p>

	<h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
	<p>
	{{ trends() }} is <a href="https://github.com/Forty-Bot/trends.tf">open source</a>. The best
	way to help out is to contribute code. I would also appreciate help from web designers or
	data analysts to improve the presentation. If you don't have programming prowess, you can
	help by <a href="https://github.com/Forty-Bot/trends.tf/issues">submitting feature requests
	and bug reports</a>. I try to prioritize features with community interest (no promises).
	</p>

	<h3>Does {{ trends() }} have an API?</h3>
	<p>
	{{ trends() }} has a <a href="{{ url_for('.api') }}">very small API</a> at the moment.
	It is mostly used for site features such as autocompletion. If you would like to see a more
	extensive API, send me a pull request, or <a
	href="https://github.com/Forty-Bot/trends.tf/issues/41">comment on the issue</a>.
